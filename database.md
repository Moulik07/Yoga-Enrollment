To fulfill the requirement of storing data in a database and providing an Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram for my Yoga Enrollment project, let's outline the database schema design and create the ER diagram.

### Database Schema Design

As my project is about yoga class enrollments, the database will likely have the following tables:

1. **Users**: To store information about the users enrolling in yoga classes.
2. **Classes**: Information about the yoga classes.
3. **Enrollments**: To keep track of which users are enrolled in which yoga classes.

#### Users Table
- **UserId** (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each user.
- **Name**: The user's name.
- **Email**: The user's email address.
- **Age**: The user's age.

#### Classes Table
- **ClassId** (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each class.
- **ClassName**: The name of the class.
- **Batch**: The batch timing of the class (e.g., 6-7AM, 7-8AM).
- **MonthlyFee**: The fee for the class.

#### Enrollments Table
- **EnrollmentId** (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each enrollment.
- **UserId** (Foreign Key): Links to the Users table.
- **ClassId** (Foreign Key): Links to the Classes table.
- **EnrollmentDate**: The date when the user enrolled.

### Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram

An ER diagram visually represents the relationships between the tables in your database. Here's a textual representation of what your ER diagram might look like:

```
Users Table
+------------+--------------+--------------+--------+
| UserId (PK)| Name         | Email        | Age    |
+------------+--------------+--------------+--------+

Classes Table
+------------+--------------+--------------+------------+
| ClassId (PK)| ClassName   | Batch        | MonthlyFee |
+------------+--------------+--------------+------------+

Enrollments Table
+----------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| EnrollmentId (PK)| UserId (FK) | ClassId (FK) | EnrollmentDate |
+----------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
```

**Relationships**:
- A **User** can have multiple **Enrollments**.
- A **Class** can have multiple **Enrollments**.
- The **Enrollments** table has foreign keys linking to both the **Users** and **Classes** tables.


Thankyou!
